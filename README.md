# Good Day and Welcome to My Page ðŸ‘‹

## I am a simple unemployed recent graduate who is just making random apps until the Job Market gets better and I get a job.

<!-- - ðŸ“« I can take any request to build whatever you want as long as it's within my abilities. (will know if I accept or don't). Also don't expect a time frame as not even I know how long it may take to finish a project. -->
No longer creating new applications. Will focus on improving the ones I already have!

- âš¡ No Longer relearning C++ as I am use to it now.
- ðŸ’¬ On the Grind to build a messenger command line app for Windows in 2 days.
- ðŸ”­ Building different useful network tools at the moment.
- ðŸ”­ Working on upgrading my [Git Website](https://infernocycle.github.io/).
- ðŸ”­ Working on upgrading [Anime News App](https://github.com/InfernoCycle/AnimeNewsScraper).
