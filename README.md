# Yahallo Welcome to My Page ðŸ‘‹

I am a simple unemployed recent graduate who is just making as many apps as possible until the Job Market stops being stupid or until the IRS comes for my Loans.

- ðŸ“« I can take any request to build whatever you want as long as it's within my abilities. (will know if I accept or don't). Also don't expect a time frame as not even I know how long it may take to finish a project.

- âš¡ Right now relearning C++ so more future apps will be built in that.
- ðŸ’¬ Currently Building a Messenger App
- ðŸ”­ Currently Building a Meijer's Information Discord Bot
- ðŸ”­ Working on upgrading my [Git Website](https://infernocycle.github.io/).
- ðŸ”­ Working on upgrading [Anime News App](https://github.com/InfernoCycle/AnimeNewsScraper).
