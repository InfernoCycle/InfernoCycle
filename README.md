## Yahallo Welcome to My Page 👋

I am a simple unemployed recent graduate who is just making as many apps as possible until the Job Market stops being stupid or until the IRS comes for my Loans.

- 📫 I am taking any request for things you may want built (intermediate level only). I can make whatever in Java, Python, JavaScript, PHP.
- ⚡Right now relearning C++ so more future apps will be built in that.
- 💬 Currently Building a Messenger App
- 🔭 Currently Building a Meijer's Information Discord Bot
- 🔭 Working on upgrading my [git site](https://infernocycle.github.io/).
- 🔭 Working on upgrading anime news app.
